## Setup Experience
Setting up my first React Native app using Expo was a valuable learning experience. Initially, I faced some issues with configuring the development environment, Once everything was set up, running the app on my emulator worked smoothly, and it was satisfying to see my customized greeting appear on the screen.

---

## Setup Steps
Created a new React Native project using npx create-expo-app.

Modified the App.tsx file to display the message: Hello, [Your Name]!.

Ran the app on an Android emulator using BlueStacks (or on Expo Go if using a real device).

Took a screenshot of the working app.

Created a private GitHub repository and pushed the project code.
